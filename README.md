# üìÇ Project Overview
This project is a VoIP (Voice over IP) and Data Network simulation created in Cisco Packet Tracer.
It integrates both voice communication (IP Phones) and data communication (PCs) with routing, switching, DHCP, SSH access, and inter-VLAN communication.

# ‚úÖ Features:

* IP Phones successfully registered and connected (VoIP enabled).

* PCs are connected and tested for inter-network communication.

* SSH access configured on routers for secure management.

* DHCP enabled for automatic IP addressing.

* Proper VLAN setup for data and voice traffic separation.
  
# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x

Networking Concepts: Routing, Switching, VLANs, DHCP, SSH, VoIP.

# üß† Skills Demonstrated
* Network design and implementation

* VoIP deployment and configuration

* Router and Switch configuration

* IP addressing and subnetting

* Secure remote access (SSH)

# üñ•Ô∏è Devices Used
* Cisco 2811 Routers

* Cisco 2960-24TT Switches

* Cisco 7960 IP Phones

* PCs

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Highlights
* Voice VLANs for IP phones.

* Data VLANs for PCs.

* DHCP server configuration on routers for IP address assignment.

* SSH configured on routers (example shown: RW1 Router).

* Static Routing or Dynamic Routing as per network needs.

* Ping Testing across different networks to ensure connectivity.

* IP Phone calling tested successfully between different departments.

# üöÄ How to Use
Open the .pkt file (Cisco Packet Tracer file) in Packet Tracer.

Review device configurations (Routers, Switches, IP Phones, PCs).

Try pinging between PCs and IP Phones.

Use SSH from PC to manage routers remotely.

Make calls between IP Phones.

Extend the network or modify IP addressing to practice further.
